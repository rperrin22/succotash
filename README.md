These are modules that I'm using to build my models for forward modelling the oceanic crust in Geosoft.

# Module list
* Model_builders
  * build_dipping_plate {builds a crustal elevation grid for import into Geosoft}
  * populate_effective_susc {*not implemented yet* will build corresponding susceptibility grid}
